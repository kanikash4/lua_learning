You can run Lua as a stand-alone interpreter which means you can write scripts that acts like stand-alone executables.

1. Create a file called luaStandAlone without the .lua extension. In the file add:

#!/usr/bin/env lua
print ("This script can be executed standalone!")

The first line tells that this is a script file and the script uses lua.
The second line prints out the text “This script can be executed standalone!” 

2. Before the script can be run, it needs to be given execute permission. To do this run the “chmod” command in the directory with the file in it:

                  chmod +x luaStandAlone

This tells Linux that this script can be executed, to run it just type:

3. ./luaStandAlone
